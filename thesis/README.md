# Thesis

I'm writing my thesis using LaTeX. For a nice workflow I chose to use overleaf as my LaTeX editor.

Just follow the link below to view the current version of my thesis :

If you find any mistakes or have some ideas and remarks I encourage you to use the comment function on overleave to leave them right there! :)
