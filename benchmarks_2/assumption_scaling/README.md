# Benchmarks : Assumption Scaling

These Benchmarks are showing the effect of increasing the size of the assumption set

Included are Benchmarks with assumption set sizes between 30 and 120 with a fixed amount of 50 internal MUCs. The
average MUC size (which means Assumptions/MUC) is kept the same over all Benchmarks at approx. 15 Assumptions/MUC
