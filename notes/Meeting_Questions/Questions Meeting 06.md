General Questions

**Q : How to build your own ASP system**

I've had a short look at the "How to build your own asp system" paper you mentioned last week, but couldn't find a part dealing with unsatisfiable cores. Am I missing something there or is there no such part in the paper?

**Q : Literature List**

You also mentioned that there is a literature list hosted somewhere in a github repo, but I wasn't able to access it last week. Is it possible for me to get access to this list?

I also checked through the references in the three papers you sent me and have collected some papers that sound interesting. I can show them to you tomorrow.
